## MODEL YIELD DISCLAIMER

The stated AP[[R]/[Y]] (the 'Rate') is denominated in terms of [RELEVANT TOKEN], not USD or other fiat currency. The Rate is a forward-looking projection based on our good faith belief of how to reasonably project results over the relevant period, but such belief is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract security risks and third-party actions) which could result in a materially different (lower or higher) token-denominated AP[[R]/[Y]]. The Rate is not a promise, guarantee or undertaking on the part of any person or group of persons, but depends entirely on the results of operation of smart contracts and other autonomous systems (including third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems after the time of your deposit. Even if the Rate is achieved as projected, you may still suffer a financial loss in fiat-denominated terms if the fiat-denominated value of the relevant tokens (your deposit and any tokens allocated or distributed to you pursuant to the Rate) declines during the deposit period.
