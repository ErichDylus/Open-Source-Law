    (b)	A “Capital Account” for the Member shall be maintained by the Company.

8.	Books, Records and Tax Returns

    (a)	The Company shall maintain complete and accurate books and records of the Company's business and affairs as required by the Statutes and such books and records shall be kept at the Company's Registered Office and shall in all respects be independent of the books, records and transactions of the Member.

    (b)	The Company's fiscal year shall be the calendar year with an ending month of December.

    (c)	The Member intends that the Company, as a single member LLC, shall be taxed as [a sole proprietorship in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Statutes.   Any provisions herein that may cause the Company not to be taxed as a sole proprietorship shall be inoperative].

9.	Bank Accounts and Blockchain Addresses. All funds of the Company shall be deposited in the Company’s name in (i) a bank account or accounts or (ii) blockchain wallet or externally owned account, as applicable and as chosen by the Member.

The Company is organized as a “member-managed” limited liability company.  The Member is designated as the initial managing member.

11.	Ownership of Company Property. The Company’s assets shall be deemed owned by the Company as an entity, and the Member shall have no ownership interest in such assets or any portion thereof.

Except as limited by the Statutes, the Member may engage in other business ventures of any nature, including, without limitation by specification, the ownership of another business similar to that operated by the Company. The Company shall not have any right or interest in any such independent ventures nor to the income and profits derived therefrom.

12.	Admission of New Members.

As a condition to the admission of a new Member, such Member shall execute and acknowledge such instruments, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to effectuate such admission and to confirm the agreement of such Member to be bound by all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement, as the same may have been amended.  Such new Member shall pay all reasonable expenses in connection with such admission, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and the cost of the preparation, filing or publication of any amendment to this Agreement or the [Articles of Organization][Certificate of Formation], which the Company may deem necessary or desirable in connection with such admission.

    (b)	No new Member shall be entitled to any retroactive allocation of income, losses, or expense deductions of the Company.  The Company may make pro rata allocations of income, losses or expense deductions to a new Member for that portion of the tax year in which the Member was admitted in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder.

    (c)	In no event shall a new Member be admitted to the Company if such admission would be in violation of applicable Federal or State securities laws or would adversely affect the treatment of the Company as a partnership for income tax purposes.

13.	Dissolution and Liquidation

    (a)	The Company shall dissolve and its affairs shall be wound up on the first to occur of: (i) at a time, or upon the occurrence of an event specified in the [Articles of Organization][Certificate of Formation] or this Agreement, or (ii) the determination by the Member that the Company shall be dissolved.

    (b)	The Company, its receivers, trustees, successors, assignees and/or transferees shall indemnify, defend and hold the Member harmless from and against any and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that are incurred by the Member (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in settlement of any action, suit, demand, investigation, claim or proceeding (“Claim”), as fines or penalties) and from and against all legal or other such costs as well as the expenses of investigating or defending against any Claim or threatened or anticipated Claim arising out of, connected with or relating to this Agreement, the Company or its business affairs in any way; provided, that the conduct of the Member which gave rise to the action against the Member is indemnifiable under the standards set forth herein. 

    (c)	Upon application, the Member shall be entitled to receive advances to cover the costs of defending or settling any Claim or any threatened or anticipated Claim against the Member that may be subject to indemnification hereunder upon receipt by the Company of any undertaking by or on behalf of the Member to repay such advances to the Company, without interest, if the Member is Judicially Determined not to be entitled to indemnification as set forth herein.

    (d)	All rights of the Member to indemnification under this Agreement shall (i) be cumulative of, and in addition to, any right to which the Member may be entitled to by contract or as a matter of law or equity, and (ii) survive the dissolution, liquidation or termination of the Company as well as the death, removal, incompetency or insolvency of the Member.

    (e)	The termination of any Claim or threatened Claim against the Member by judgment, order, settlement or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, cause the Member not to be entitled to indemnification as provided herein unless and until Judicially Determined to not be so entitled.

15.	Miscellaneous

    (a)	This Agreement and the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of [STATE OF ORGANIZATION]. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

To the extent any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or otherwise ineffective under the Statutes, such provision shall be considered to be ineffective to the smallest degree possible in order to make this Agreement effective under the Statutes.
