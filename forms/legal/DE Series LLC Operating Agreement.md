Notice is hereby given that the Company is hereby established as a Series under the Master LLC Agreement.

A member participating in one Series will have no rights or interest with respect to any other Series, other than through that Member's interest in that Series independently acquired by that Member. This Agreement and all provisions herein will be interpreted in a manner to give full effect to the separateness of each Series. The Manager shall take reasonable steps as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section. Without limitation on the preceding sentence, the Manager shall maintain separate and distinct records for each Series, shall separately hold and account for the assets of each Series, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 18-215 of the Act. The dissolution and termination of the Company will not, in and of itself, cause or result in the dissolution or termination of the Master LLC or any other Series.

Dealing with Third Parties.

Except as otherwise expressly provided, nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to create any fiduciary relationship between Members for any purpose whatsoever, apart from obligations between the members of a limited liability company as may be created by the Act.

c.	The Manager shall cause the Company to pay any taxes or other governmental charges levied against or payable by the Company; provided, however, that the Manager will not be required to cause the Company to pay any tax so long as the Manager or the Company is in good faith and by appropriate legal proceedings contesting the validity, applicability or amount the tax and the contest does not materially endanger any right or interest of the Company.

Allocation of Net Income and Net Loss. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Net Income and Net Loss (including individual items of profit, income, gain, loss, credit, deduction and expense) of the Company will be allocated among the Members in a manner such that the Capital Account balance of each Member, immediately after making that allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to the Distributions that would be made to that Member pursuant to Article X if the Company were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their Fair Market Value, all Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Fair Market Value of the assets securing that liability), and the net assets of the Company were distributed in accordance with Article X to the Members immediately after making that allocation, adjusted for applicable special allocations, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets.

VII.	DISTRIBUTIONS
Generally. The Company will first use available assets to repay outstanding debts and obligations, if any, of the Company. Then, the Company will make Distributions, at times and intervals as the Manager will determine. Amounts apportioned to a Member will be distributed to the Members who have made a Capital Contribution pursuant to Article IV, pro rata in accordance with Interests held by them.
Return of Distributions. Any Member receiving a Distribution in violation of the terms of this Agreement shall return that Distribution (or cash equal to the net fair value of any property so distributed, determined as of the date of Distribution) promptly following the Member's receipt of a request to return the Distribution from the Manager. No third party will be entitled to rely on the obligations to return Distributions set forth in this Agreement or to demand that the Company or any Member make any request for any return.
Cryptocurrency as a Distribution: Valuation Policy. For Distributions that include Digital Assets, the valuation of those Digital Assets will be made by the Manager on the basis of the fair market value of those Digital Assets as of the Set Valuation Date determined in good faith by the Manager.

VIII.	TRANSFERS
Right of First Refusal. In the event that a Member proposes to sell, pledge or otherwise transfer to a third party any Membership Interest, the Company shall have the Right of First Refusal with respect to all (and not less than all) of such Membership Interests.  If the Member desires to transfer Membership Interests, the Member shall give a written transfer notice to the Company describing fully the proposed transfer, including the number of Membership Interests proposed to be transferred, the proposed transfer price, the name and address of the proposed transferee and proof satisfactory to the Company that the proposed sale or transfer will not violate any applicable federal, State or foreign securities laws.  The transfer notice shall be signed both by the Member and by the proposed transferee and must constitute a binding commitment of both parties to the transfer of the Membership Interests.  The Company shall have the right to purchase all, and not less than all, of the Membership Interests on the terms of the proposal described in the transfer notice by delivery of a notice of exercise of the right of first refusal within 30 days after the date when the transfer notice was received by the Company.
Rights of Assignee. An assignee has no right to vote, receive information concerning the business and affairs of the Company and is entitled only to receive Distributions and allocations attributable to the Interest held by the assignee as determined by the Manager and in accordance with this Agreement.
Enforcement. The restrictions on Transfer contained in this Agreement are an essential element in the ownership of an Interest. Upon application to any court of competent jurisdiction, a Manager will be entitled to a decree against any Person violating or about to violate those restrictions, requiring their specific performance, including those prohibiting a Transfer of all or a portion of its Interests.

IX.	RECORDS, REPORTS AND TAXES

Winding Up. Upon the occurrence of any event specified above, the Company will continue solely for the purpose of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner, liquidating its assets, satisfying the claims of its creditors, and distributing any remaining assets in cash or in kind, to the Members in accordance with this Agreement. The Liquidating Trustee will be responsible for overseeing the winding up and liquidation of the Company and will cause the Company to sell or otherwise liquidate all of the Company's assets except to the extent the Liquidating Trustee determines to distribute any assets to the Members in kind, discharge or make provision for all liabilities of the Company and all costs relating to the dissolution, winding up, and liquidation and distribution of assets, establish reserves as may be necessary to provide for contingent liabilities of the Company (for purposes of determining the Capital Accounts of the Members, the amounts of those reserves will be deemed to be an expense of the Company and will be deemed income to the extent it ceases to be reserved), and distribute the remaining assets to the Members, in the manner specified below.
Liquidation. The Company's assets, or the proceeds from the liquidation of the Company's assets, will be paid or distributed in the following order:
a.	first, to creditors to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law in satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations of the Company, including expenses of the liquidation (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment), other than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities, if any, for Distributions to Members;
b.	next, to the establishment of those reserves for contingent liabilities of the Company as are deemed necessary by the Liquidating Trustee (other than liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and liabilities, if any, for Distribution to Members and former Members under the Act);
c.	next, to Members and former Members in satisfaction of any liabilities for Distributions under the Act, if any;
d.	next, to the Members, on a pro rata basis.
Distributions in Kind. Any non-cash asset distributed to one or more Members will first be valued by the Manager at its Fair Market Value to determine the Net Income, Loss and special allocations that would have resulted if that asset had been sold for that value, which amounts will be allocated pursuant to Article VI, and the Members' Capital Accounts will be adjusted to reflect those allocations. The amount distributed and charged to the Capital Account of each Member receiving an interest in the distributed asset will be the Fair Market Value of that interest as determined in good faith by the Manager (net of any liability secured by the asset that the Member assumes or takes subject to).  
No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon a liquidation, if any Member has a negative Capital Account balance (after giving effect to all contributions, Distributions, allocations and other Capital Account adjustments for all Fiscal Years, including the Year in which that liquidation occurs), neither that Member nor any Manager will have any obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company, and the negative balance of that Member's Capital Account will not be considered a debt owed by that Member or any Manager to the Company or to any other Person for any purpose.
Limitations on Payments Made in Dissolution. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, each Member will be entitled to look only to the assets and proceeds thereof of the Company for Distributions (including Distributions in liquidation) and the Parties will have no personal liability for any Distributions.

XI.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; STANDARD OF CARE; INDEMNIFICATION

Standard of Care. Neither the Members nor the Covered Persons will have any personal liability whatsoever to the Company, any Member, or their Affiliates on account of that Person's role within the Company, or by reason of that Person's acts or omissions in connection with the conduct of the business of the Company so long as that Person acts in good faith for a purpose which the Person reasonably believes to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company. Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing contained in this Agreement will protect that Person against any liability to which that Person would otherwise be subject by reason of (a) any act or omission of that Person that involves gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or willful and material breach of a material provision of the Agreement or (b) any transaction from which that Person or its Affiliate derives any improper personal benefit.  
Indemnification. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Covered Persons will be entitled, out of the Company assets, to be indemnified against and held harmless from any and all liabilities, judgments, obligations, losses, damages, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings (whether under any action, civil or criminal, pending or threatened, before any court or administrative or legislative body, and as the same are accrued, in which an Indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise or with which he, she or it may be or may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter (a "Proceeding")) and reasonable costs, expenses and disbursements (including legal and accounting fees and expenses) of any kind and nature whatsoever (collectively, "Covered Losses") that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted at any time against an Indemnitee (whether or not indemnified against by other parties) in any way related to or arising out of this Agreement, the administration of the Company, or the action or inaction of an Indemnitee (including actions or inactions pursuant to Article X on the Company's dissolution or termination) or under contracts with the Company, except that the Covered Persons will not be entitled to indemnity for Covered Losses with respect to any matter as to which an Indemnitee has been finally adjudicated in any action, suit, or other proceeding, or otherwise by a court of competent jurisdiction, to have committed an act or omission involving their own gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or reckless disregard of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.
