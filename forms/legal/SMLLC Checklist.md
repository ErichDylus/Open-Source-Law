# Single Member Limited Liability Company Formation Checklist

_First step is always to consult a *lawyer in your jurisdiction* for any legal considerations including state of organization, and an *accountant* for tax including whether your SMLLC with be taxed as a pass-through or a corporation (and therefore filing IRS form 8832)_

- Choose a name and search the applicable state's corporate directory to ensure availability (for example, [Delaware's Division of Corporations Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx))
- `State` ensure your chosen name complies with state law. For example, many states require "LLC", "L.L.C.", or "Ltd." as a suffix for your entity name, and there are usually restrictions on certain sensitive or materially misleading names (for example, a carpentry business probably should not be named "Cardiac Surgeons LLC")
- `State` check whether any professional licensing is required for your commercial operation
- Consider using a corporate service for formation of the entity and necessary state filings (including payment of annual fees and handling annual reports). Popular choices include LegalZoom, Zenbusiness, etc.
    - such services may also assist in any "doing business as" (DBA) name filings, annual property filings, etc.
- `State` most states require a registered agent for your LLC. Whether the registered agent's address may be used as the LLC's address is also state-by-state, as some require registration of the primary address where your business is conducted (which for many SMLLCs is a personal home).
- `State` have your lawyer draft an LLC Operating Agreement, to be signed by you (individually) and the LLC
- Open a bank account dedicated to your LLC so as not to commingle LLC funds with personal funds
- If accepting crypto, consider a centralized exchange or other "off-ramp" account for your LLC if accepting crypto payments (for some business types, permission for this may be a `State` consideration)
    - also consider further ways to separate your LLC crypto income/assets from personal assets such as registering an ENS for your LLC's public address that includes your LLC's name 
- Keep a Confirmation of Accounts document with your LLC's blockchain address(es) and other accounts
- Consider using bookkeeping software to keep track of income and expenses, and calculate estimated federal quarterly taxes. Options such as Quickbooks will provide aggregated forms for annual tax filings.
- Consider an [EFTPS](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/) account for paying quarterly estimated federal tax payments online from your bank account
- `State` each state has its own system for paying quarterly estimated state taxes; these estimated amount payments can often be scheduled in advance for a taxable year
- Consult a CPA for annual tax filings/payments and any necessary informational filings, as well as any other tax or accounting concerns
- Consult a lawyer for:
    - contracts your LLC may enter into, including any form agreements you may want your clients to sign (of course, your lawyer should be involved any time a contract is being signed)
    - any litigation activity (obviously)
    - any necessary IP protections, such as copyright or trademark filings for your LLC's name, logo, or products if applicable
    - any other legal or regulatory concerns
