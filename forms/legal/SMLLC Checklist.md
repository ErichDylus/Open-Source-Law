# Single Member Limited Liability Company Formation Checklist

_First step is always to consult a *lawyer in your jurisdiction* and an *accountant*_

- [ ] Choose a name and search the applicable state's corporate directory for availability (for example, [DE's Division of Corp. Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx))
- [ ] `State-specific` ensure your chosen name complies with state law. For example, many states require "LLC", "L.L.C.", or "Ltd." as a suffix for your entity name, and there are usually restrictions on certain sensitive or materially misleading names (for example, a carpentry business probably should not be named "Cardiac Surgeons LLC")
- [ ] `State-specific` check whether any professional licensing is required for your commercial operation and `Local-specific` whether any permits are needed
- [ ] Consider using a corporate service company for formation of the entity, registered agent, and state filings (including payment of annual fees and handling annual reports). Popular choices include LegalZoom, Zenbusiness, etc.
    - such services may also assist in any "doing business as" (DBA) name filings, annual property filings, etc.
- [ ] `State-specific` ask your lawyer whether the registered agent's address may be used as the LLC's address, as some require registration of the primary address where your business is conducted (which for many SMLLCs might be a home address).
- [ ] `State-specific` have your lawyer draft an LLC Operating Agreement, to be signed by you (individually) and the LLC
- [ ] Open a bank account for your LLC 
- [ ] If accepting crypto, consider a centralized exchange or other "off-ramp" account for your LLC if accepting crypto payments (for some business types, permission for this may be `State-specific`)
    - also consider further ways to distinguish and separate your LLC crypto income/assets from personal assets, for example an ENS for your LLC's EOA/multi-sig that includes your LLC's name 
- [ ] Keep a private Confirmation of Accounts document with your LLC's blockchain address(es) and other accounts
- [ ] Consider using bookkeeping software to keep track of income and expenses, and calculate estimated federal quarterly taxes. Options such as Quickbooks will provide aggregated forms for annual tax filings.
- [ ] Consider an [EFTPS](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/) account for paying quarterly estimated federal tax payments online from your LLC's bank account
- [ ] `State-specific` each state has its own system for paying quarterly estimated state taxes; these estimated amount payments can often be scheduled in advance for a taxable year and auto-withdrawn from your LLC's bank account (make a note of these payment dates)
- [ ] Consult a CPA for annual tax filings/payments, as well as any other tax or accounting concerns including whether your SMLLC should be taxed as a pass-through (most common) or a corporation (and if so, filing IRS form 8832 and arranging other necessary administrative tasks)_
- [ ] Consult a lawyer for:
    - contracts your LLC may enter into, including any form agreements you may want your clients to sign (of course, your lawyer should be involved any time a contract is being signed)
    - any litigation activity (obviously)
    - any necessary IP protections, such as copyright or trademark filings for your LLC's name, logo, or products if applicable
    - any other legal or regulatory concerns
