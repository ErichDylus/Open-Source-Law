# Single Member Limited Liability Company Formation Checklist

_First step is always to consult a *lawyer in your jurisdiction* and an *accountant*. Applicability of each item in this list may vary according to your particular details._

- [ ] Choose a name 
    - search the applicable state's corporate directory for availability (for example, [DE's Division of Corp. Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx))
- [ ] `State-specific` ensure your chosen name complies with state law
    - for example, many states require "LLC", "L.L.C.", or "Ltd." as a suffix for your entity name, and there are usually restrictions on certain sensitive or materially misleading names (for example, a carpentry business probably should not be named "Cardiac Surgeons LLC")
- [ ] `State-specific` check whether any professional licensing is required for your commercial operation 
- [ ] `Local-specific` check whether any licenses or permits are needed for your LLC's business
- [ ] `State-specific` file the necessary formation documents, or consider using a corporate service company for formation of the entity, registered agent, and state filings (including payment of annual fees and handling annual reports). 
    - popular choices include doola, Zenbusiness, LegalZoom, etc.
    - such services may also assist in any "doing business as" (DBA) name filings, annual property filings, etc.
- [ ] `State-specific` ask your lawyer whether the registered agent's address may be used as the LLC's address
    - some states require the primary address where your business is conducted (which for many SMLLCs might be a home address)
- [ ] `State-specific` have your lawyer draft an LLC [Operating Agreement](https://github.com/ErichDylus/Open-Source-Law/blob/main/forms/legal/Single%20Member%20LLC%20Operating%20Agreement.md), to be signed by you (individually) and the LLC
- [ ] Open a bank account for your LLC 
- [ ] Purchase business/professional insurance for your LLC
- [ ] Register service accounts for your LLC
    - email address, domain (if applicable), and anything else you'll use for your LLC's business (cloud storage, GitHub, social media, etc.)
    - update professional profiles
- [ ] If accepting crypto, consider a centralized exchange or other "off-ramp" account for your LLC if accepting crypto payments (for some business types, permission for this may be `State-specific`)
    - also consider further ways to distinguish and separate your LLC crypto income/assets from personal assets, for example an ENS for your LLC's EOA/multi-sig that includes your LLC's name 
- [ ] Keep a private Confirmation of Accounts document with your LLC's blockchain address(es) and other accounts
- [ ] Consider using bookkeeping software to keep track of income and expenses, and calculate estimated federal quarterly taxes. 
    - options such as Quickbooks will provide aggregated forms for annual tax filings
- [ ] Apply for an [EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) if applicable.
- [ ] File your beneficial ownership information report with FinCEN: [E-Filing](https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/fileboir). Ask your lawyer about any exemptions or for assistance.
    - Companies that exist or are registered prior to January 1, 2024 have one year to file initial reports. Companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2024 have 90 days after creation or registration to file. Companies created or registered on or after January 1, 2025 have 30 days after creation or registration to file. If there are any corrections or changes of ownership, a new report must be filed within 30 days.
- [ ] Consider an [EFTPS](https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/) account for paying quarterly estimated federal tax payments online from your LLC's bank account
- [ ] `State-specific` each state has its own system for paying quarterly estimated state taxes.
    - these estimated amount payments can often be scheduled in advance for a taxable year and auto-withdrawn from your LLC's bank account (make a note of these payment dates)
- [ ] Consult a CPA for annual tax filings/payments and any other tax or accounting concerns
    - for example, whether your SMLLC should be taxed as a pass-through (most common) or a corporation (and if so, handling IRS form 8832 and other necessary payment flows and administrative tasks), or what retirement account/plan may best suit your situation
- [ ] Consult a lawyer for:
    - contracts your LLC may enter into, including any form agreements you may want your clients to sign (your lawyer should be involved any time a contract is signed)
    - any litigation activity (obviously)
    - any necessary IP protections, such as copyright or trademark filings for your LLC's name, logo, or products if applicable
    - any other legal or regulatory concerns
