###  I. Nature of Charter and Name of the DAO
(a) This charter (this “Charter”) is the official legal charter of [DAO NAME] (the “**DAO**”). This Charter is intended to be a legal agreement & contract binding upon all DAO Members and the other DAO Participants, as they may join and exit the DAO from time to time, as each such term is defined herein, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms under the laws of the District of Columbia. Certain capitalized terms used in this Charter are defined in Section VI. 

(b) If you have received any DAO Membership Token or are otherwise a member of [DAO NAME], you consent to & agree to become legally bound by this Charter as both a DAO Participant and more specifically a "DAO Member" as such term is defined in this Charter.    

(c) [DAO NAME] is an unincorporated nonprofit association under the District of Columbia Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act of 2010 (D.C. Stat. Title 29, Ch. 11) (the “**DC UUNAA**”).  [DAO NAME] is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership. This Charter together with the Designated Smart Contract comprise the ‘governing principles’ of the DAO, as such term is defined in §29–1102 of the DC UUNAA.

###  II. Purposes and Structure of the DAO
(a) The DAO is a "decentralized autonomous organization", or a collective of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons, which defers certain aspects of the governance, structure, operations, and other capabilities to the consensus mechanisms, computations, and data storage and transactions of the Designated Smart Contract’s code and underlying permission-less blockchain.

(b) The DAO Members shall utilize the Designated Smart Contract (as such term is defined in Section VI of this Charter) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating among the DAO Members, and spending or otherwise distributing, any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing any DAO Membership Tokens, of holding and recording votes of the DAO Members, and setting or altering parameters to the Designated Smart Contract, as applicable. The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the DAO, the DAO Members and/or third Members.

(c) The primary purposes of the DAO are to facilitate, support, promote, operate, represent and advance [DAO PURPOSES] (the “**Purposes**”).

The ability to become a Member, as defined in §29–1102 of the DC UUNAA, shall be voluntary and application open to any individual of at least 18 years of age whose purpose or presumed intent is commensurate with the Purposes and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of membership including the terms of this Charter, and follow the applicable membership processes.

(c) DAO Members shall have the rights, powers and privileges that are possible to be taken or exercised by DAO Members through the Designated Smart Contract as further set forth in Section IV which are in accordance with this Charter. The rights, powers and privileges of DAO Members are referred to herein as the "**DAO Membership Rights**".

(d) Status as a DAO Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the DAO Membership Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a DAO Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of the DAO or any other DAO Member, to bind the DAO or any other DAO Member to any Contract or Liability or to Convey (as such term is defined in Section IV(A)(ii) below) any DAO Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of the DAO or any DAO Member.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no DAO Member shall be deemed the partner of the DAO or any other DAO Member. No DAO Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such DAO Member or any other DAO Member has any such authority, right or power.  

(e) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no DAO Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) Liable for any Liability of the DAO or any other DAO Member. This clause "(e)" shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of the DAO or any DAO Member to indemnify or compensate any DAO Member from, or hold any DAO Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the DAO Member's participation in the DAO or otherwise.
