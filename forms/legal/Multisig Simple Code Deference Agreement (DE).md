## MULTISIG SIMPLE CODE DEFERENCE AGREEMENT 

[PARTY A NAME] (“***Party A***”) controls the private key uniquely associated with Account Address 0x_________ on the Designated Blockchain. [PARTY B NAME] (“***Party B***”) controls the private key uniquely associated with Account Address 0x_________ . [PARTY C NAME] (“***Party C***”) controls the private key uniquely associated with Account Address 0x_________ (Party A, Party B and Party C together, the “***Parties***”). The respective private keys controlled by the Parties are uniquely associated with the multi-signature Account Address 0x_________ (the “***Multisig***”) on the Designated Blockchain, any transaction from which necessitates the authorization from multiple of the Parties' respective addresses according to the smart contract code of the Multisig. For good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby enter into this Multisig Simple Code Deference Agreement (this "***Agreement***") as of [DATE] (the “***Effective Time***”).

**1. Subject Property**

(a) No later than 72 hours after the Effective Time (the “***Deposit Deadline***”) (A) the Parties shall cause, by operation of the Multisig, the Designated Tokens to be Transferred from the Multisig in the amount set forth for each applicable recipient party in [Annex A hereto][that certain [INSERT AGREEMENT DETAILS]].

(b) Any Tokens required to be deposited into the Designated Smart Contract or the Multisig, together with any Token proceeds, yield, or other earnings thereon or other Token amounts that are received or transmitted by the Designated Smart Contract or the Multisig during the term of this Agreement, are referred to herein as the “***Subject Property***.” Any Subject Property that has been Transferred to a Party by the Designated Smart Contract or via the Multisig is referred to herein as such Party’s “***Distributed Subject Property***.”

(A) certifying that the Sending Party believes in good faith that there is a Material Adverse Exception Event;

(B) describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons forming the basis of such belief;

(C) describing in reasonable detail a proposal by such Party of the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought by the Parties in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event an “***Exception Handling Proposal***”;

(ii) *Exception Standstill.* During the period commencing upon the earlier of a Party becoming aware that there is a Material Adverse Exception Event or being delivered an Exception Notice and ending with the Parties entering into an Exception Handling Addendum or receiving a final decision of an arbitrator in accordance with Section 2(b)(iii) (the “***Standstill Period***”), such Party shall: (A) treat all of the Distributed Subject Property of such Party that may have been Transferred to such Party as a result of the Material Adverse Exception Event as if it were Subject Property, including by disregarding the parenthetical exceptions for Distributed Subject Property in Section 2(a)(iii); and (B) deposit and maintain such Distributed Subject Property in a segregated Account Address to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a custodial trust held for the benefit of the other Parties.

(iii) *Determination of Exception Handling.*

(A) The term “***Exception Handling Addendum***” refers to an addendum to this Agreement signed by the Parties and setting forth the Parties’ agreement on the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. Each Exception Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the Parties be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Agreement.

(B) If the Receiving Parties wish to accept the Exception Handling Proposal in full, then the Receiving Parties shall promptly deliver a written notice of such acceptance to the Sending Party and the Parties shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the Exception Handling Proposal.

(C) If any Receiving Party disputes the existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event, or does not wish to accept all or any part of the Exception Handling Proposal, then such Receiving Party shall promptly deliver a written notice of such non-acceptance an “***Exception Response Notice***” to the Sending Party. The Exception Response Notice shall include the same categories of information, statements, evidence and representations and warranties as would be required for an Exception Notice, *mutatis mutandis*.

(D) During the continuous 30-day period beginning on the date after the date the notice of non-acceptance is delivered to the Sending Party the “***Negotiation Period***”, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree upon the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and, if so agreed, the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into and the remedies to be sought by the Parties in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event. If the Parties agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the Parties shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.

(E) If the Parties fail to reach an agreement resulting in an Exception Handling Addendum during the Negotiation Period, then a Party may initiate an arbitration action to resolve the issues in accordance with the procedures set forth on *Exhibit A* (the “***Arbitration Procedures***”). The decision resulting from the Arbitration Procedures shall include, among any other determinations, a determination of the treatment of any Distributed Subject Property and whether to extend, modify or terminate the covenants applying to the Distributed Subject Property during the Standstill Period.
