Autonomous attorney disclosure {

*Last updated: 28 April 2021*

Please be advised: I am an attorney admitted to practice in the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia. Unless we have entered into a written and mutually signed engagement letter providing for legal services, I am not your attorney and do not represent you or your interests. 

From time to time I engage as an "autonomous attorney" -- this means that in analyzing or discussing legal, regulatory or law-related matters, or creating related public or open source materials, I am representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. Such communities and affiliated persons are not my clients, and I have no intention to treat their information as confidential or attorney-client privileged. I am acting on my own behalf, but will seek to provide accurate and honest information while observing my general nonrepresentational professional and ethical responsibilities.

In engaging as an autonomous attorney, I am not acting on behalf of any law firm or any other entity, nor on behalf of any client (one with whom I have a signed engagement letter providing that I will act as their attorney). If my views expressed in autonomous attorney contexts are inaccurate or are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me and an injured party will not be covered by malpractice insurance.

I currently have economic interests in and contractual obligations with API3 DAO (legally wrapped as The API3 Foundation), and may engage as an autonomous attorney in the API3 DAO and LexDAO communities from time to time. I may have indirect economic interests in the various projects and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time.

I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date.
